#SVNDIR should be defined to appropriate svn root

export SVNDIR=~/svn

#change to scripts directory, upload all the files (novacom utility should be in path)

cd $SVNDIR/scripts
./upload

#on device use either runner script:
./runner


#or run the following before cxx tests are run, to appropriately modify the hosts file:
./modifyHosts

#after this you can run the tests as many times as you want:
./CxxTests

#run the following to restore  /etc/hosts to its original state, after testing has finished:
./restoreHosts
